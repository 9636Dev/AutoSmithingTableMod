# Auto Smithing Table Mod (Legacy Source Code)

New source code at: [HW9636/AutoSmithingTableRewrite](https://github.com/HW9636/AutoSmithingTableRewrite)

Auto Smithing Table is a mod that adds additional functionality for the **smithing** function in minecraft. Currently, there are only versions for *1.18* and *1.19*. 

## Functionality

Auto Smithing Table adds a new custom block to minecraft, with the `id` of `autosmithingtable:auto_smithing_table`. This block allows the automation of the **smithing** process, using Forge Energy (FE). \
Currently, timing and energy costs are applied to all recipes, but this will be changed to allow custom recipes with the custom recipe type `autosmithingtable:auto_smithing`.

## Future Plan

A full rewrite of AutoSmithingTable is currently in progress. The aim of the rewrite is to provide better user experience (UX) and an easier-to-use interface.

Auto Smithing Table will be ported to 1.20 **as soon as possible**, but due to the high number of changes in the smithing mechanics, this could take some time.
The backport to 1.16.5 will be released after the 1.20 release. 

## Addons / Api

Currently, addon support and public APIs are not being considered.
